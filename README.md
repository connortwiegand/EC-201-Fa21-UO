# EC-201-Fa21-UO
First Time Teaching EC 201. 

Very grateful to Kyle Raze (https://kyleraze.com/ and https://github.com/kyleraze/EC201_Microeconomics), his slides and examples are much better than my own, and some of his materials were directly used in my own slides. 

Grateful to Andrew Heiss (https://www.andrewheiss.com/ and https://github.com/andrewheiss/reconPlots) and R-CoderDotCom for econocharts (https://github.com/R-CoderDotCom/econocharts) and similar resources. 

If you are not listed here and think I used something of yours and would like credit, contact me.
If you make real use out of the materials provided in this repo, similar credit to me is appreciated.
